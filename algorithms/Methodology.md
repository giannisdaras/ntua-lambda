## Binary search 



It can be used to solve various problems.

* Find element in a sorted array.
* Find first occurrence of an event in a discrete/continuous search space.
  * We return low or high which represents the minimum (first event occurrence).
  * The return condition is `low >= high`.
  * For continuous problems, the return condition is `low >= high + epsilon`.
