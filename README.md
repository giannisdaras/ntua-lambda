# About
This repository expects to be a place to find code/resources/examples and more, related to the NTUA lambda flow.

# Documentation
Each course should be added to a seperate folder.
The files related to the course in general (such as theory and advanced exercises) should be added to the subroot folder of the
course.
Exercises for each course should be added to a seperate folder indicating their year. Ideally, we would love to have the 
question as well, together with the solution.


**Important note:** All exercises solutions should be added **after** the deadline. This repo does not encourages cheating.
It's main purpose is to collect resources that will enable better engagement with the courses of this flow.



# Contribution
Feel free to open a pull request for anything that you might find relevant. 
For example, previous years exercises solutions are always welcome for comparison between the years and deeper understanding
of the course.
